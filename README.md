### What I learned

It was my first time putting my svg (the cart icon) in my css as i always happed to be adding it inline in my html 
or using fontawsome icons ^ ^ but I can't say much about my html as is only 30 lines of code but you could see the picture tag.

```css
.button[data-icon="trolley"]::before{
    content: "";
    background-image: url(images/icon-cart.svg);
    width: 15px;
    height: 16px;
}
```
